# Real-Time-Temperature-Monitoring-and-Alert-System
IOT based monitoring system with real time alert via call using GSM module through FRDM KL25z with NRF module and Wi-Fi module.

### The Aim of This Project is to:

•	Notify residence and neighbours for FIRE ALERT through SMS and Call.
•	Help to prevent any major loss of life or property.
•	Overcome the issue of resident outside the apartment knowing about the situation very late, could lead to loss of life or more damage to property.
•	Notify the neighbours to leave the building immediately, so they can carry their important and personal belongings.

### Hardware:

•	FRDM KL25z - 2 Boards with cables
•	Arduino Uno - 1 Board with cable
•	ESP8266 - Wi-Fi Module
•	DHT11 - Temperature and Humidity Sensor
•	NRF24L01+ 2.4GHz - 2 Wireless RF Transceiver Modules
•	SIM800L - GPRS GSM Module
•	Jumper Cables - M to M, M to F, F to F wires
•	Breadboard
•	PC or Laptop
•	SIM card
•	

### Software:

•	ThingSpeak – open source Internet of Things (IoT) application
•	ARMmbed - Embedded Progamming Platform
•	Arduino IDE
•	CoolTerm - Serial Port Terminal

This project is divided into three parts:
1. Sensor and Transmitter part.
2. Receiving and Wi-Fi part.
3. Alerting using GSM module part.

Each part has its own folder and own code.
