# Real-Time-Temperature-Monitoring-and-Alert-System
IOT based monitoring system with real time alert via call using GSM module through FRDM KL25z with NRF module and Wi-Fi module.

### The Aim of This Project is to:

- Notify residence and neighbours for FIRE ALERT through SMS and Call.
- Help to prevent any major loss of life or property.
- Overcome the issue of resident outside the apartment knowing about the situation very late, could lead to loss of life or more damage to property.
- Notify the neighbours to leave the building immediately, so they can carry their important and personal belongings.
